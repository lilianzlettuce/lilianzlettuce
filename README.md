### Hey there ðŸ‘¾

Iâ€™m Lilian, a high school junior from California, and I like making things, especially when it involves weird games and fun stuff. My current focus is primarily on web development and UI/UX design, but I'm also proficient in Java, and I plan on exploring other tech fields in the future!
